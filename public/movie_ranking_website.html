<h3>The Departed (2006)</h3>
<p>A masterclass in tension, deception, and moral ambiguity, The Departed distills Scorsese’s crime storytelling into a razor-sharp thriller. <br />
Its layered performances, relentless pacing, and exploration of identity and loyalty make it one of the most electrifying modern crime films ever made. <br />
</p>

<h3>Casino</h3>
<p>More than a gangster movie, Casino is an epic autopsy of power, greed, and excess. Scorsese’s meticulous direction, operatic style, and <br />
unflinching portrayal of corruption turn Las Vegas into a character itself, creating a visually stunning and thematically ruthless portrait <br />
of rise and collapse. <br />
</p>

<h3>The Godfather II (1974)</h3>
<p>Widely regarded as the greatest sequel ever made, The Godfather Part II deepens the original by juxtaposing legacy and isolation. Its parallel <br />
narratives, moral complexity, and tragic transformation of Michael Corleone elevate it beyond crime cinema into timeless, Shakespearean storytelling. <br />
